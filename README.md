# SOLID Principles in C#

Welcome to my SOLID training repository ‚Äî designed for practical learning and real-world thinking.  
Each folder is dedicated to one SOLID principle and contains:

- üí° A real-world analogy (e.g. banking, reporting, device control)
- üß© A challenge to implement
- üîç A C# solution applying OOP tools (interfaces, abstractions, etc.)
- üß† My own notes and decisions

## üë£ Principles Covered

| Principle | Description | Documentation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| S - SRP  | Single Responsibility: Each class does one thing well | [Documentation](https://github.com/rezatajari/SOLID-Principles/blob/master/doc/SRP.md) |
| O - OCP  | Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification | [Documentation](https://github.com/rezatajari/SOLID-Principles/blob/master/doc/OCP.md) |
| L - LSP  | Liskov Substitution: Derived types must be usable as base types | [Documentation](https://github.com/rezatajari/SOLID-Principles/blob/master/doc/LSP.md) |
| I - ISP  | Interface Segregation: No client should depend on what it doesn't use | [Documentation](https://github.com/rezatajari/SOLID-Principles/blob/master/doc/ISP.md) |
| D - DIP  | Dependency Inversion: High-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level modules | [Documentation](https://github.com/rezatajari/SOLID-Principles/blob/master/doc/DIP.md) |

This repo is not about copying answers.  
It's about **thinking like a software designer**:  
- Model real-life problems
- Apply core OOP patterns
- Practice reasoning before coding
