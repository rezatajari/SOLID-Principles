# SOLID Principles in C# - Challenge-Based Learning

Welcome to my SOLID training repository — designed for practical learning and real-world thinking.  
Each folder is dedicated to one SOLID principle and contains:

- 💡 A real-world analogy (e.g. banking, reporting, device control)
- 🧩 A challenge to implement
- 🔍 A C# solution applying OOP tools (interfaces, abstractions, etc.)
- 🧠 My own notes and decisions

## 👣 Principles Covered

| Principle | Description | Folder |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| S - SRP  | Single Responsibility: Each class does one thing well | `SRP_SingleResponsibility` |
| O - OCP  | Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification | `OCP_OpenClosed` |
| L - LSP  | Liskov Substitution: Derived types must be usable as base types | `LSP_LiskovSubstitution` |
| I - ISP  | Interface Segregation: No client should depend on what it doesn't use | `ISP_InterfaceSegregation` |
| D - DIP  | Dependency Inversion: High-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level modules | `DIP_DependencyInversion` |

## 🧠 Learning Style

This repo is not about copying answers.  
It's about **thinking like a software designer**:  
- Model real-life problems
- Apply core OOP patterns
- Practice reasoning before coding
